# sEMGRecognition  
Tips:For the paper of this work is not published yet, dataset and the code cannnot be open-source.  
Work focusing on the Machine learning and deep learning methods for the lower limb motion recognition based on sEMG signals and Network pruning for the deployment on the microcontroller for real-time recognition.  
**DATASET**: sEMG signals of different lower limb motions are included in our dataset.  
**Neural network**: Different machine learning and deep learning methods are used to test performance for recognition.  
**Network pruning**: Network pruning is needed to shrink the model size to deploy on the source-limited microcontroller for real-time recognition.
